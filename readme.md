# 3D Printing Notes
This repo is meant to be a notepad for me as I jot down tips/tricks I learned while 3D printing.

## Metric Screws
The `Cylinderhead_screw_M6` model from [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3259952) post is **10x10mm**. If you would like to build a thread *into* another object that you can then screw this screw into, enlarge the screw to **12x12mm**. This provides enough room for the screw to fit into. Not enlarging the screw means the hole is not large enough to fit in.
